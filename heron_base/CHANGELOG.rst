Changelog for package heron_base
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0.1.10 (2022-01-26)
-------------------
* Refactor the base-station ping check to use a standard ping; the snmp check is consistently failing with our current configurations.
* Contributors: Chris Iverach-Brereton, Tony Baltovski

0.1.9 (2021-12-14)
------------------
* Add the no-wireless lights script to the install targets
* Contributors: Chris Iverach-Brereton

0.1.8 (2021-12-14)
------------------
* Add support for a HERON_NO_WIRELESS envar to completely disable checking for wireless connectivity; if enabled, just tell the MCU the wireless is fine and suppress the slow-2-pulse
* Change the default IP address for the SNMP check to be the actual address of the base-station.
* Contributors: Chris I-B, Chris Iverach-Brereton, Tony Baltovski

0.1.7 (2021-05-18)
------------------
* Fix bugs related to the switch to CV5 (`#11 <https://github.com/heron/heron_robot/issues/11>`_)
  * Use relays instead of remap; remap doesn't work in an include.  Add additional necessary dependencies
  * Set the IMU to operate in ENU mode instead of the default NED
  * Rename the microstrain nodes to use "imu" instead of "cv5" to be more universal
* Contributors: Chris I-B

0.1.6 (2021-02-12)
------------------
* Replace now-defunct UM6 as default, use CV5-25 instead, as-per RPSW-661 (`#10 <https://github.com/heron/heron_robot/issues/10>`_)
  * Remove all references to the now-defunct UM6, as-per RPSW-661
  * Add the Microstrain CV5 launch configuration as the new default. We're going to move forward and publish the driver off our own build farm, so depending on it shouldn't cause long-term issues (though it won't work right now)
  * Remove the notes to check topics & devices; they are checked & are correct.
* Merge pull request `#9 <https://github.com/heron/heron_robot/issues/9>`_ from heron/mag-arg
  Allow disabling the magnetometer input to the IMU filter
* Add an env var to disable the magnetometer input to the IMU filter, for instances where the IMU does not support that
* Merge pull request `#8 <https://github.com/heron/heron_robot/issues/8>`_ from heron/no_imu_compass
  Remove the imu_compass dependency
